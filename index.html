					<h1>My Sister's Funeral </h1> 
					<h2> Gerald Stern, 1925</h2>
					<p class="sonnet-sections">
						Since there was no mother for the peach tree we did it 
						all alone, which made the two of us closer
						though closeness brought its loneliness, and it would
						have been better I think sometimes to be sterile
						from the start just to avoid the pain 
						which in my life this far has lasted seventy
						years for I am in love with a skeleton
						on whose small bones a dress hung for a while,
						on <span id="fave">whose small skull a bit of curly hair
						was strung</span>, and what is dust I still don't know
						since there was no mother to turn to then and ask
						what else was she wearing, did she have on shoes,
						and were the two trees from Georgia, and was it
						true somebody said the other peach
						should have died instead of her; and I could 
						imagine the nose going first though forty years later
						the trees were still there and not as big as you’d think;
						and it was my cousin Red with the flabby lips
						who said it, he had red eyes, a red monstrosity,
						a flabby body, half the house was filled with 
						male cousins, they were born in rooms a 
						short distance from the rats, I can't remember
						which ones had the accents nor what his
						Hebrew name was, nor his English.

					<h1>Sonnet[Nothing was ever what it claimed to be,]</h1>
					<h2> Karen Volkman</h2>
					<p class="sonnet-sections">
						<span id="fave">Nothing was ever what it claimed to be</span>,
						the earth, blue egg, in its seeping shell
						dispensing damage like a hollow hell
						inchling weeping for a minor sea

						ticking its tidelets, x and y and z.
						The blue beneficence we call and spell
						and call blue heaven, the whiteblue well
						of constant water, deepening a thee,

						a thou and who, touching every what—
						and in the or, a shudder in the cut—
						and that you are, blue mirror, only stare

						bluest blankness, whether in the where,
						sheen that bleeds blue beauty we are taught
						drowns and booms and vowels.  I will not.
